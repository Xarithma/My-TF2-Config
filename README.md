# Zede's TF2 configuration

**My beloved configs compiled together into a single repo.**

## How to install

1. Download the latest 
[release](https://github.com/Zedespook/zede-tf2-config/releases/).
2. Go to your Steam library and right click on Team Fortress 2.
3. Click Propertiesâ€¦
4. Click the Local Files tab.
5. Click Browse/Browse Local Files
6. Extract the `tf` folder inside the ZIP file to WHERE your `tf` folder is
   when you clicked browse.
7. Enjoy!

## Where's the HUD, though?

Since all HUDs are kind of subjective, and since they would be the largest part
of this repo, I decided to archive them into a ZIP file. Installing is simple:

1. Go to your Team Fortress 2 folder -> tf -> custom
2. Extract the `toonhud.zip` archive.
3. Enjoy!
